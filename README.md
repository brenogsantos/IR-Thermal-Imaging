# IR-Thermal-Imaging

- ***Work in progress...***

- **The desktop application aims to facilitate the visualization of Infrared array sensors through the serial port.**

- ## To Use

# Clone this repository 
git clone https://github.com/brenogsantos/IR-Thermal-Imaging.git
# Go into the repository
cd IR-Thermal-Imaging
# Install dependencies
